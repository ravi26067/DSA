## Statement

You’re given an integer array `height` of length `n`, and there are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i,0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines from the input array that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds as much water as possible. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Note:** You may not slant the container.

**Constraints:**

- `n = height.length`
- 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
- 0 ≤ height[i] ≤ 10^3

# Examples

## Example 1:

Input: height = [2,8,6,3,5,4,7]
Output: 35

## Example 2:

Input: height = [8,2,6,3,5,4,7]
Output: 42
